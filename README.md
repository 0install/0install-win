Directory structure
===================

- The directory `src` contains the Visual Studio solution with the actual source code.
- The directory `lib` contains pre-compiled 3rd party libraries which are not available via NuGet.
- The directory `doc` contains scripts for generating source code and developer documentation.
- The directory `modeling` contains UML and other diagrams.
- The directory `installer` contains scripts for creating a Windows installer.
- The directory `bundled` contains a portable GnuPG distribution (Windows only) and an external solver (all platforms).
- The directory `build` contains the results of various compilation processes. It is created on first usage. It can contain the following subdirectories:
  - Backend: Contains the libraries forming the Zero Install Backend.
  - Frontend: Contains the executables for the Zero Install Frontend plus all required libraries (including the Backend).
  - Tools: Contains the executables for Zero Install Tools such as the Feed Editor plus all required libraries (including the Backend).
  - Installer: Contains the generated installers.
  - Documentation: Contains the generated source code documentation.
- The top-level directory contains local Zero Install feeds referencing the contents of the `build` directory. They can be registered with `0install add-feed` in order to replace the online versions of Zero Install and its tools with your local builds.

`VERSION` and `VERSION_UPDATER` contain the version numbers used by build scripts.
Keep in sync with the version numbers in `ZeroInstall.xml`, `ZeroInstall_Tools.xml`, `ZeroInstall_Updater.xml`, `src/AssemblyInfo.Global.cs`, `src/Updater/AssemblyInfo.Updater.cs` and `src/Frontend/OneGet/oneget.manifest`!



Windows
=======

The external solver (required) is not included in the repository. To get it run `bundled/download-solver.ps1`.

`build.cmd` will call build scripts in subdirectories to create a Zero Install for Windows installer in `build/Frontend/Installer`.
Note: Please read `installer/readme.txt` aswell for information about required tools.

`cleanup.cmd` will delete any temporary files created by the build process or Visual Studio.



Linux
=====

The external solver (required) is not included in the repository. To get it run `bundled/download-solver.sh`.

`build.sh` will perform a partial debug compilation using Mono's xbuild. A installer package will not be built.

`cleanup.sh` will delete any temporary files created by the xbuild build process.

`test.sh` will run the unit tests using the NUnit console runner.
Note: You must perform a Debug build first (using `src/build.sh`) before you can run the unit tests.



Environment variables
=====================

- `ZEROINSTALL_PORTABLE_BASE`: Set by the C# code to to inform the Python code of Portable mode.
- `ZEROINSTALL_EXTERNAL_FETCHER`: Set by the C# code to make the Python code delegate downloading files back to the C# implementation.
- `ZEROINSTALL_EXTERNAL_STORE`: Set by the C# code to make the Python code delegate extracting archives back to the C# implementation.
