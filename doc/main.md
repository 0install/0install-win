The Zero Install Frontend consists of the libraries `ZeroInstall.Commands` and `ZeroInstall.Central` as well a set of executables. This is the main UI and command-line interface of Zero Install.

This API documentation shows the internal structure of the Frontend components. It is intended primarily for developers contributing to Zero Install or interested in its inner workings.

If you are interested in embedding Zero Install functionality in their own .NET applications, please refer to the [Zero Install .NET Backend API](http://0install.de/api/backend/) instead.
