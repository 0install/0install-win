This folder contains Sandcastle Help File Builder projects for generating source code and developer documentation.
The resulting documentation files are placed in ..\build\Documentation.

The "build.cmd" script assumes "..\src\build.cmd Debug" has already been executed.

The "build.cmd" script will generate the documentation using the Sandcastle Help File Builder v1.9.1.0 (which uses Sandcastle).
